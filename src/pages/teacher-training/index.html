      <p>At Blackbird Yoga Studio we combine elements of many traditions including vinyasa, hatha, alignment-based and restorative to create a yoga that is functional. Our sole mission is to help our students move, breathe, and feel better in their own bodies.
        This Yoga Teacher Training (YTT) will prepare you to lead a safe and effective group class as well as provide private 1:1 sessions.</p>

      <h2>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN</h2>
      <div class="teacher-training--content-row">
        <div>
          <p>You will learn about the history of yoga and the traditions that have shaped the modern landscape of postural yoga. You will come to understand yoga as lifestyle; and explore in depth The Eight Limbs of Yoga and the Yoga Sutras as set forth
            by Patanjali. You will also learn about the energetic body, the chakra system, Ayurveda, bhakti yoga and chanting.</p>
          <p>You will learn the fundamentals of human anatomy and physiology as they pertain to yoga postures as well as safe and thoughtful class sequencing techniques. You will learn to give effective hands-on assists, and to practice and teach pranayama
            (breathwork) and meditation.</p>
          <p>We will discuss the ethics and business of the yoga industry, and you will learn to market yourself should you choose to teach.</p>

          <p>We pride ourselves on your readiness to teach by the end of the training, and ample time will be spent practice-teaching with feedback by our experienced staff. However, many students choose to complete a teacher training with no intention of
            ever leading a group class; they simply wish to deepen their personal understanding and practice of yoga and we welcome this with open arms.</p>
