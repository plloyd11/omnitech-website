                <p class="mb20">Automated Equipment is designed to reduce production costs, improve product quality and expand capacity.
                    Often the equipment replaces existing manual operations and becomes the sole production source for a
                    particular product or products. Accordingly, it's critical that the equipment be operated and maintained
                    in way that guarantees it is always operating at it optimal performance levels.</p>
                <p>Unlike many "machine builders" OMNITECH backs up it's outstanding automated equipment design and assembly
                    operations with a full-range of Customer Support Services including:</p>
                <p>OMNITECH strives to offer same-day service to technical questions and on-site maintenance.</p>
                <p>Buying automated equipment from OMNITECH gives you the piece of mind that there's a team of professionals
                    available to you for urgent needs, questions and technical issues.</p>

            <p>Automated Equipment is often highly complex machinery that includes a significant amount of electronics and sophisticated
                mechanical mechanisms. Accordingly, the maintenance and repair of this equipment can sometimes be time-consuming
                and difficult.</p>
            <h3>24/7/365</h3>
            <p>To control costs, most companies try to minimize on-hand inventory. This operating strategy puts significant
                pressure on manufacturing to produce product consistently and without interruption, often 24/7/365. This
                means that the automated equipment used for production needs to operate at its optimal performance levels
                with minimal down-time. A decrease in equipment performance or frequent or prolonged down-time can have a
                significant impact on a company's inventory and costs.</p>

            <p>Automated Equipment is often complex, usually incorporating high-speed assembly, vision, testing, welding, printing
                and other operations that are PLC or computer controlled. Although OMNITECH's equipment is designed and assembled
                to guarantee many years of operation, under normal use, the equipment needs to be adjusted and maintained
                periodically to guarantee that it is operating at its maximum performance levels.</p>
            <p>Identifying incorrect parameter settings, errors in station set-ups and problems with commercial hardware is
                often difficult. In many cases customers do not have the time or the technical resources to periodically
                inspect equipment. Over time, slow, subtle degradation in the equipment's performance can occur. Left unaddressed,
                this can leave to serious performance issues or even machine downtime and costly repairs.</p>
            <h2>Maintain High Performance Levels - Minimize downtime - Reduce Maintenance Costs $$$</h2>
            <p>By periodically inspecting equipment and performing any necessary repairs, serious performance issues, machine
                downtime and significant repair/maintenance costs can be avoided.</p>
            <p>OMNITECH's WatchDog Program is a Preventative Maintenance Inspection Program. Customers who sign-up for this
                program will have an Omnitech Technician visit their facility at set intervals (chosen by the customer) to
                inspect their equipment then provide them with a thorough report, detailing the technician's observations
                and recommendations. Any necessary repairs and maintenance can be performed by the customer or Omnitech.</p>
