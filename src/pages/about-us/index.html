                            <p class="mb20">In 1985, Donald Jackson Sr purchased the company and changed the name to Omnitech Automation, Inc. For 20 years prior to taking over Omnitech, Mr. Jackson had been employed by Mechanical Services, Inc., an Allentown, PA manufacturer of automation equipment. In 1987, Mr. Jackson relocated Omnitech to its current location in Emmaus, Pennsylvania.</p>

Mr. Jackson, the company’s Executive Vice President, is responsible for automation concept development.</p>
